  articleHeadline: BUGER FLIPPING CONTEST DISASTER
  articleStory: Burger flipper David Fleep was gravely injured while flipping what
    was defined by specialists as "The lamest flip in burger flipping history". In
    an attempt to flip a burger patty as high as he could, David lost balance due
    to his uneven weight caused by the massive difference in the size of his arms.
    David slipped and fell breaking his arms and hitting a spectator in the face
    with a patty at an enormous velocity. He was disqualified and sent to the nearest
    hospital along with the spectator, who might not be able to consume solid food
    again. "Worsth thay oth my lithe", says the spectator. Thougts and prayers go
    out to Mr. Fleep in this time of need. Wife files for divorce.
