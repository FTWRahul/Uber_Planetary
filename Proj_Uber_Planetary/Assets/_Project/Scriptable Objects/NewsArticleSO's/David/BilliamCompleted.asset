  articleHeadline: HOSPITAL FLOODED WITH FOOD POSIONING CASES
  articleStory: The local system's hospital got flooded with cases of food poisoning.
    Since any of the pacients have been able to properly speak since their arrival
    at the hospital, it's hard to determine the cause of this surge. According to
    one of the doctors, the only piece of intelligable speech they were able to get
    from the patients was "something about hodge podge". Authorities have detained
    owner of local buisnes "The Soup Emporium" for interrogation on the matter.
